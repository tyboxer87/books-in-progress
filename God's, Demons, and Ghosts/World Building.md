The two headed gods are determined to rule all other gods, despite thier relatively small powers. Decay sayw the power of humans, and wanted to influence them. He gave some of his power to enhance them. Creating the dark side

All Gods send spirts to help thier subjects

The life side of the two headed sends spirts
The decay side sends demons to coerce humans

The humans power is their ability to imagine and see patterns. Demons take these thoughts and amplify them. The feed on stress to grow fears and anxieties. The create illusions. The fears can seem useful to a human. But can drive a human mad. The dark side gods don't care though. 

A human might look at their house 
Greed will say "Its not good enough you need more to be happy"
Shame will say "you're letting your family down they deserve better than this. They deserve better than you"
Isolation will say "No body will want to come to your house its not good enough"
Hatred will say "It someone else fault its not better. They're why its not good enough"
Despair will say "This house will rot and collapse. You aren't good enough to stop that."

He may believe that for a while. But the more he believe is the weaker he becomes. If he can't break free from the demons control he'll collapse. Maybe even die.

The demons seem like friends. Proctecting the man. But he knows something isn't right. 

He sees a shaman. The shaman tells him those demons aren't his friends. They serve the dark gods first.
