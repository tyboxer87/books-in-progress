## Draft

As humankind's learns to live with other intelligent beings, the city of Asuncion is being designated as a safe haven for human living. The city will be a bastion of human values, where biological human needs are top priority. No person, software, tools, or infrastructure shall be allowed that does not fully respect human lives.

### Citizenship and Rights

1. Human
	1. Any person in the city will be considered human if they meet the following criteria:
		1. no Non-human body enhancements
		2. neural Interface
	2. All humans will have the right to
		1. move freely through all public spaces
		2. arm and defend themselves from bodily harm or insults to their human dignity
		3. a fair and speedy trial if accused of a crime
		4. freedom from cruel or unusual punishment
		5. emergency services for life threating situations
2. Citizen
	1. Citizenship will be granted to any human with permanent residence in Asuncion that meets one of following conditions
		1. Was born in the city
		2. Completed 1 year of military service
		3. Completed a heroic act to preserve human dignity, as determined by the city council  
				*Narrator notes* - This clause was used to to recruit terrorists from around the globe. Such as, the infamous case of the terrorist known as Apegon, the Spaniard, who severed the Gibraltar power bridge. His goal was to cut off the Northern African data centers from European power. For a time it did force the digitals in the African data centers to sleep when the sun went down. They had  massive solar farms but little baseload energy or storage. The attack caused massive economic harm and electrical infrastructure problems in Europe. Within a month the bridge was back up. With in a year nuclear plants were coming online across Algeria. With in 5 years power flowed the other way across the bridge. Its alleged Apegon fled to Asuncion and was welcomed as a hero. The attack was meant to hurt the digitals. But what didn't kill them just made them stronger. 
3. Citizens are granted the right to
	1. Own land, structures, or intellectual property
	2. Vote in village elections
	3. Serve on village councils
	4. Trade goods and services with any human or semi-human inside or outside of the city
	5. Work that provides for their needs and the needs of their immediate family.
4. Semi-Human
	1. Asuncion is designed for fully human living but understands that fully human living may not fit for every individual. Semi-human status may be grated by a level 2 council to any individual that meets the following criteria
		1. Consciousness is fully contained in the human brain. 
		2. All enhancements are integrated into and contained in the body
	2. Semi-human are granted the right to 
		1. rent living spaces in the city
		2. sell goods and services to humans and semi-humans inside the city
		3. Move freely though areas designated for semi-humans
		4. Defend themselves from bodily harm from other semi-humans
5. Semi-Citizen
	1. Semi-humans can receive semi-citizenship by meeting the following criteria
		1. Completed 2 year of military service
		2. Completed a heroic act to preserve human dignity, as determined by the city council
			*Narrator Notes* - This was had a high bar than citizens. Most human's who completed "heroic acts", were destroying infrastructure for notoriety. And since it only got them second class citizenship, the was generally only used by fugitives fleeing serious crimes. Its rumored the cyborg suspect in the Cape Town nuking used to this clause. Although his motives weren't ideological, he still needed a place to find sanctuary, and he found it in Asuncion
	2. Semi-Citizen Rights include
		1. All rights of semi-humans
		2.  the right to own land for personal use with the consent of the village councils containing and bordering the land. 
		*Narrator Notes* - This class was the necessary lower class. It was needed to interact with Non-human laborer. A simple neural port would disqualify a person from full citizenship but allowed for communication orders of magnitude faster than a full human and full digital could achieve. 
6. Non-human laborer - For the good of Asuncion's economy non-human labor may be used. Their work must be contracted for with a citizen.  The contract will be upheld by both parties but no other explicit rights will be granted to non-human laborers. 
		*Narrator Notes* - This was the slave class. Sometimes Asuncion would recruit the most desperate digitals. But mostly it bought contracts from foreign governments, typically prisoners serving a sentence. Digital and Bios from all over the world were happy to dump their digital prison population into Asuncion. With a virtual gun to their head this class keep the city running. 

### Agriculture 
1. Being essential to human life, Asuncion will always produce a net positive amount of food. 
2. International trade of food products is encouraged, but Asuncion must never become reliant on imports for any food product
3. The city will ensure 2 years of food stores in case of emergency
	1. Food storage will be managed by the city council
4. All agricultural activity must be supervised by the citizen owning the land
	*Narrator Notes*  While it may be obvious at this point it still deserves to be said. The "non-human" slaves worked the field through bots. The "semi-humans" managed working crews. And a citizens kept their hands on the trigger of the virtual gun to the "non-humans".  The defense rights laid out made sure lower classes didn't have any *legal* recourse to defend or fight back against higher classes. This was how "preserved human dignity".

### Infrastructure
Being a city for humans the city's infrastructure's primary goal will be to facilitate human living
1. Roads must
	1. Allow human driven cars and trucks
	2. Include a walkable paths
	3. Have speed limits manageable by an average human driver
	4. Have safety measures to protect pedestrians and occupants of vehicles
	5. A department of transportation will be created to oversee road safety and design.
		*Narrator Notes* - Ohh boy did the semi-humans hate Asuncion's roads. Even some humans too. There were no bot drivers going 150+mph. Just stop and go traffic. You'd be lucky ot find a place you could go over 40mph. Made the whole city feel slow. Like a early 19th century town.
2. Water 
	1. All buildings must have clean safe water for human consumption
	2. All waste must be sent to certified sanitation systems 
	3. A department of water management will be created by the city council to ensure every human in the city has access to clean water.
3. Electricity
	1. All power generation must not pollute air, water, or land in any way that jeopardizes human health.
	2. All buildings must be connected to the city's power grid
	3. Energy consumption for human living, such as heating and cooling, water pumping, lighting, food preparation; will be prioritized over non-human infrastructure such as data centers and data transmitters. 
	4. A department of energy will ensure our electrical infrastructure meets the needs of the city
		*Narrator Notes* - This a was a big reason many semi or non-humans didn't not want to live in Asuncion. Data centers' power was unreliable. Semi-humans might loose connections to remote systems. Annoying if you needed those systems to process information. Dangerous if that device needed connections to continue functioning. Even more dangerous if you're entire consciousness was digital. Many lives were lost in Asuncion data center power outages. They were usually quickly replaced with a new prison population though
4. Information Network
	1. The city shall maintain an internet to connect digital devices. 
	2. The primary purpose of the internet will be to aid humans in learning, communicating, and entertainment, but may also be used for non-human purposes
	3. It may be connected to outside sources, but must include measures to immediately disconnect and shut down the network
	4. Other infrastructure may use the network but must never be reliant.  
	5. A department of information will be created to oversee the internet in Asuncion and manage its outside connection
		*Narrator Notes* The rules around the information network is where we begin to see the paranoia of Asuncion. Although many say it wasn't paranoia consider their intent to antagonize the rest of the world.
		
### Security 
It would be naive to think our lifestyle and intent to protect a way of life will be accepted by the rest of the world. We know we will have foreign adversaries. In order to maintain our peace we must engage in the oldest and most fundamental aspect of human society, protection 

1. Each village must
	1. Maintain bunker capable of withstanding at least a 10 megaton nuclear attack.
	2. Have at least 2 active duty military personnel, and 2 reserves in case of emergency, paid for and supported by the village.
	3. Maintain an arsenal of small arms to equip at least 1/2 of its population
	4. Be capable of self sufficiency for 6 months
2.  The city council will maintain a nuclear arsenal as a deterrent. 
3. Active duty military will work full time and report to the Asuncion military command
4. Reserve personnel must have sufficient training as designated by the Asuncion military command.
	*Narrator Notes* The city made massive investments into its defense. So it's not surprising they felt the need to use it. Asuncion might have survived many centuries if it hadn't let its paranoia turn to violence. There were plenty of terrorists attack. Some claimed by Asuncion and some denied but were obviously the work of Asuncion Military. The international community was already weary of Asuncion's actions when it pulled off its most violent attack on Rio de Janeiro. Rio had been a shining example of biological and digital co-existence. By offering free to its poorest citizens and building its self as a hub for internet traffic it was booming economically and culturally. The Asuncion military placed old caches of fuel, lumber, and ammunition strategically around the city especially near data centers and power plants. Then in a coordinated attack it ignited all the flammable caches at ones. The whole city burned. The death toll is still debated. But everyone agrees this killed far more biological humans than digitals. But that didn't matter to the fanatics in Asuncion. They saw those biologicals as complicit in the rise of digital life. The international condemnation was swift, and the Brazilian Alliance swiftly declared war.  Other South American city's gave support, but Asuncion was heavily fortified and armed with nukes. Once the Antarcticians pledged to fight along side the Brazilians Asuncion knew its days were numbered. 
### Amendments
While we have faith that this charter can endure, we understand that the future is unpredictable. Should the city become unsustainable amendments may be written with 3/4 of level 1 counselors approving it. 

*Narrotor notes* With Antartican and Brazilian forces making small advanced towards the city core. Only a few level 1 counselors remained. The voted to cede all power to the mayor. The forces continued closer, and the mayor decided the cities fate. He detonated the entire nuclear arsenal in place. It turned the city into a crater. The arsenal was much larger and any international watchdog estimates had guessed. The Brazilian and Antartican forces were gone but so was Asuncion. Since the nukes were underground Every bunker collapsed. They were never intended to withstand the megatonnage of a full nuclear arsenal. The area is heavily irradiated to this day. A scar on the globe and hopefully an enduring warning.
