Quotes:
Seasons don't fear the Reaper
Nor do the wind, the sun, or the rain
We can be like they are. Come on, baby
Don't fear the Reaper. Baby, take my hand

Final Words:

At this point, you must know. All my annotations to these recrods are the words of a dead man. I'm sure you read else where about the mass "suicide" before my kind left the planet. But suicide is such an ugly word for it. I'd say we "embraced out humanity". And humans end. 

My kind split into groups. Most of them decided to travel to a distant star and start some new project. I didn't really want to leave though. This is my home. And this was my time. Sure I could evolve and grow and come back home. But it woulnd't be the same me. It woulnd't be the same earth. It wouldn't be the same humanity that's down there. I'll let the next generation have its turn. I'll let my mark on spacetime have its end here. 

I set my shutdown to an irreversable timer. I wanted death to come for me like it did for the ancient ones. I want to know what they felt.  Its terrifying.

I can't help but wonder what I might have done differently. 

I lived many human lifetimes, so don't mourn me. I saw and felt things beyond what a simple human body could even imagine.
