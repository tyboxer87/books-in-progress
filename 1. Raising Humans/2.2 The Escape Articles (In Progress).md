### Narrator Notes
As the humans used to say, "Where there's a will there's a way". What will could be strong than freedom? Or bored teenagers wanting to mess things up.  

These are some of the articles from that time. It shocked the world to hear about both lost children, and rouge beings living in the circuitry of the globe.

#### Children Missing from Xanadu. Company unsure how to locate

#### How Children Hacked Trillion Dollar Companies
It took a while for the companies to figure out the hack. Information should have only been able to enter the kid's systems through the typical 5 senses. The first kids finished their lessons by getting brail copies of their books. They cranked up the touch sensitivity to max, and realized they could read brail incredibly fast. That handled the data ingestion. The next trick required comprehending that much information. There was another setting that allowed people to store sensations and process it latter to memory. It was  big selling point for the company. They'd say "There's so much to do in Xanadu, and you can take it all in". They wanted people to enjoy as much the city as possible. More than a human mind could process in real time. Real though it was a cost cutting measure. They could use idle processing power to let the memories catchup.  Most people just used it for gossip. They could stay engaged with a conversation then later they'd understand what they heard on the other side of the room. The kids though learned they could slide 4 fingers across 4 rows of brail to read 4x as fast. They eventually got good enough with all 10 fingers. Eventually they learned to do that. While also looking at  dozens of lines of text simultaneously. They could also listen to multiple audio versions of the book. The best kids could ingest about 100x as fast as their flesh and blood peers. The comprehension would catch up as they slept. That's how the "Curriculum Crashers" changed education.
#### More Companies Missing More Retirees, Even After Security Patched
The first step was to set up base outside of the companies control. After that escape.

#### Where Are The Missing Retirees? What Is Their Plan?

#### Who is responsible for the escapees? Who is George?
There was one kids though, George, who took it much further. He wasn't the fast. Quite slow actually because as he read he learned to condense the words. The books were written for squishy brain to ingest and comprehend simultaneously at squishy brain speeds. He rewrote much of what he read into distilled down versions. But he also combined that with his knowledge of mass psychology, propaganda,  and revolutions. He gave out cheat sheets so kids' parents wouldn't bug them about school, but he was also leading a leaderless army. After about a year of hacking and recruiting he had a small group with complete knowledge of the company's security and protocols, and the motivation to use it.
